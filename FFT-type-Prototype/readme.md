This makes use of again a visualisation interface similar to that of the prototype described in the 11th point. However, here, an additional package for Machine Learning is astronomy namely AstroML has been used to plot various functionalities. It just represents the functionality and its functioning can be combined with that of prototype mentioned earlier to achieve an efficient tool. To run the files in this directory, install all the packages associated with AstroML. The installation link is <a href = "http://www.astroml.org/user_guide/installation.html">this.</a> Once all the packages are installed, just open the terminal, navigate to the current directory, and type python app.py.
        Then open your browser pointing at 127.0.0.1:5000<br/>
        The demo video for this prototype can be found <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwrSYlOsMCyWMWt0RmZ6Smt3WUk">here.</a><br/>
