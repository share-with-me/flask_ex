# flask_ex
This repo contains some of the examples applications using python flask server. To run the python files:<br/>
    1. Open your terminal <br/>
    2. Navigate to the current directory <br/>
    3. Make sure you have installed all the requirements . If not, most modules can be downloaded via <br/>
          pip install module_name <br/>
      But make sure you have installed pip before. The manual for installation can be found <a href = "https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/"> here</a><br/>
    4. Run the python script by typing: <br/>
          python filename.py<br/>
    5. The host url and port number can be found in the terminal if the server starts correctly. They can also be found in the source code of the corresponding python file. <br/>
    6. Navigate to your browser and type the host url and the port number to see the result of script. <br/>
    7. The folder 'outputs' contains a demo file 'data.csv' which is used for the purpose of demonstrating the download.py script.<br/>
    8. The folder 'templates' contains the corresponding html files which will be rendered depending upon the script running.<br/>
    9. The folder 'uploads' is the directory where the files that are uploaded in the 'file.py' are stored.<br/>
    10. The folder 'Matplotlib_with_flask' consists of files that make use of matplotlib to render plots via flask.<br/><br/<br/>
    
    <b>Important</b><br/>
    11. The folder 'Prototypes_v0.9' contains:<br/>
        7 directories in total which target various features of a prototype. The directory 'type7_FFT' is a very important one as it makes use of the features present in the above 6 directories as well as it has its features of its own. All of the prototypes do make use of matplotlib along with flask. A demo video of the prototype under this directory type7_FFT can be found <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrSYlOsMCyWQXF4TVNtVnVvS2M/view?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here</a>.
